The classic guidance is **three to six months of essential expenses**, but the right number depends on income stability, household structure, and insurance coverage.

| Situation | Suggested months | Rationale |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| Dual income, stable jobs | **3** | Two paychecks cushion a single job loss |
| Single income, stable job | **4–5** | No second earner to absorb a gap |
| Variable / gig income | **6–9** | Income itself is the risk |
