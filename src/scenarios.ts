//
//   "degraded"/"issues"    → answers fine, but reports several non-fatal
//                            problems on the summary (plus one streamed, to
//                            exercise dedupe by code) after a fallback search
//                            and a failed rerank attempt
//   "error"                → two tool calls succeed, then the stream dies
//                            mid-answer with a fatal error event
//   "fail"                 → two quote sources fail before a cached one
//                            succeeds and gets range-checked; the model
//                            recovers and answers
//   "50"/"stress"          → a corpus is ranked, then an answer citing 50
//                            references (scale test)
//   "cite"/"source"/"save" → a corpus is searched, then an answer citing a
//                            handful of references
//   "tool"/"search"/"rate"/"market"
//                          → four sequential tool calls (rates, index moves,
//                            volatility, allocation) before the answer
//   anything else          → cycles through the default scenarios
//
// Every scenario below runs 4–6 `thinking` steps — the model reacting to
// each tool result in turn, not one paragraph decided up front — interleaved
// with however many tool calls its story needs. `runScenario` folds all of
// it into one `thought` block and reactivates the reasoning shimmer each
// time thinking resumes after a tool call, so none of this needs any
// client-side support beyond what already exists.
